## What's this?

Orbital Probe Cannon (OPC) is a tool designed to facilitate interaction with backdoors such as Rusthorn. However, it is crucial to understand that this tool can be used in ways that closely resemble command-and-control (C2) malware operations.

Using OPC to interact with unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical. This tool is meant solely for educational and research purposes within controlled environments where you have explicit permission. Acceptable use cases include:

- Security research
- Penetration testing (with proper authorization)
- Ethical hacking scenarios where all parties involved consent to its use
  
Unauthorized deployment of OPC may violate cybercrime laws, including but not limited to the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) and General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Misuse can lead to legal consequences, including criminal charges and civil liability.

Additionally, improper use of OPC could pose serious security risks, including data breaches and full-system compromise. Deploying this tool on unsecured networks, personal devices, or any unauthorized environment could expose you to threats beyond your control.

By using OPC, you agree to use it ethically and legally. You take full responsibility for how this tool is used. This tool must never be used for financial gain, unauthorized access, or military applications.

## But why use this?

The first version of Rusthorn had significant flaws due to its design for intuitive use with curl. Issues like password interception and WAF detection required security improvements that ultimately made direct interaction via curl impractical. As a result, an interface was developed to abstract and secure communication.

## Not working/Missing files

Both this tool and Rusthorn are currently in development, stable and working versions will be marked via releases.
